there is a universal and whether the universal has any existence in its own

While Thomas uses Avicenna in solt-ing the problein of universals, it is neces-
sary to note that he does not stress :Nvicenna's doctrine that community and
singularity are both accidental to nature.

'l‘lw next probletn is 'l'homas' theory os knowledge In this section os the
cs'apicnriulc we do not have 3 complete treatise on knowledge. There are only
indications of a theory of knowing found in remarks which are incidental to
tlte treatises on substance and number. Thomas proposes two theories: the
Δ»111611511111311 doctrine ot' illumination and the Aristotelian doctrine ot' abstraxe*
tion He makes no attempt to synthesize these two views ot' knowledge into
one consistent theory. Rather he places the two side by side. In the treatise on
substance he speaks ot' abstraction as though it were natural to 111311, 3 necessary
condition ot* knowledge t'or man in any condition or state. In the 11631156 on
numbers, where he constantly proposes Augustinian doctrine. he speaks of
another type ot* knowing 111 which man receives forms from above XVhen
speaking of this second kind of knowledge, Thomas also mentions abstraction.
He takes notice ot* 1116 fact that Aristone spoke as though abstraction were the
only type of apprehension. and he seems to think that ,λι-15111116 spoke too
rcstrictively. He proposes an Augustinian doctrine ot' sensation. in which the
soul is not passive, bnt rather active. sensing‘ by being attentive to the (115111111-
311665 of the body. The soul can receive none ot‘ its perfectioris t'rom the body.
He also proposes the Augustinian theory that the forms within the ,511111 measure
those outside the soul and are prior to them. It is difficult to 566 how these
doctrines 6311 be harmonized with an Aristotelian doctrine of knowledge. It
would seem that Thomas 15 111 the incipient stages of a tradition which will
associate St. Angustiae and Aristotle in one consistent theory ot' knowledge.

The doctrine of spiritual matter is adopted into Thomas' psychology and
angelology. The reason for 11115 is that a sels-subsistent soul is demanded by
the Δ-1111611511111311 doctrine ot* illumination. If the soul is to bc active of itself.

to delitnit its form. Every substance must have matter in order to mark 115
diversity t'rom God and from other substances. It 15 evident that Thonias' teach-
ing on matter comes from Avicebrol, the great proponent of the universality
ot' matter.
