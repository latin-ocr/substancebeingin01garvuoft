( Abstract)

Thomas οἱ York was a Franciscan oi the thirteenth century. a student
and teacher at Oxt'ord. l.ittle is known οἱ his lil'e. Even the date of his death
is not certain. but it is presutned to have occurred between 1259 and 1269.

l-{is principal work is the S‘npivntiulv, in which are collected the doctrines
ιη’ tha· better known christian antl pagan authors οἱ his day. In order to study
Thomas' doctrine of substance and certain affiliatcd problems. it was necessary
to edit the fourth and fifth books υἱ this magistrat work. This work exists in
three known manuscripts, of which the manuscript from the Florence librat-y.
ciui* (mir. supp. Ab. 437, was chosen as basic.

The purpose of the thesis i> to locate this early Franciscan in his historica!
position, relating hini to the Augustinian tradition and to the Aristotelian
intluences t'ound in his work. The forty chapters of books four and five of the
snpimtialc concern themselves with substance and accidents. The first ten
chamon« give a clear vit-w οἱ Thomas' ‹loctrine on substance. There are several
other kei· mediaeval problems treated in these two books which facilitate the
task oi placing him historically. 'l'hc material can be dix-idm] into five main
parts which treat oi Thoinas' doctrine of substance. his theory ιη’ knowledge.
-piritual matter. the doctrine o1' being and his use of authorities.

In his teaching on substance lhonias adheres very closely to the Aris—
totelian sources he uses, ,semime substance is coniposetl ιη’ matter and form.
sorni furnishing the innnutable source oi being and knowledge. matter having
the t'unction ot' deliniiting the form. The quiddity or cssence of sensible sub-
<tance is the iorni. §latter in no way enters into the essence. but is only a
part υἱ the integral whole. This iorni which is the essence is not a separated
form. as l’lato holds. hut a form inherent in the substance. He uses Aristotle's
arguments against Plato. Neither the being. nor the knowledge nor the genera-
ti·=n oi sensihle substances can be explained by separate forms. The essence of
sensihle substance is the form, which is in the individual. Thomas attempts to
discover if this form is the saint· a> the specific form. In showing that the
connuon iorni oi the species and the form ot' the individual are the same, he
uses ,xx-{emma} doctrine o1' a threet'old ως( of common nature. The form or
common nature has an csse in itself. an msc in the species. ire. the t'orni as
universal. ami an cxxxx-r in the individual. ie. the iorni as particular. The form.
while having a ‹liversity ot* csse, remains one in nature. Hence the quiddity οἰ
sensilile substance is in a sense the specific form.
